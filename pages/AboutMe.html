        <p>I'm a prehistoric hunter, living in nowadays South-Eastern Europe. I'm part of the
            Epigravettian culture, which was one of the last archaeological
            industries and cultures of the European Upper Paleolithic. It emerged after the Last Glacial Maximum around
            ~21,000 cal. BP or 19,050 BC, and is considered to be a cultural derivative of the Gravettian culture.
            Initially named Tardigravettian (Late Gravettian) in 1964 by Georges Laplace in reference to several lithic
            industries found in Italy,[4] it was later renamed in order to better emphasize its independent character.
            Our culture is the last stage of the Upper Paleolithic succeeded by Mesolithic cultures after 10,000 BP, so
            I can be considered the last European hunther gatherer.If you want to catch a glimplse of the magical
            Paleolithic Europe, watch this video:

        <p>As all human species during that time, I'm a hunter-gatherer. Hunter-gatherer cultures forage or hunt food
            from
            their environment. Often nomadic, this was the only way of
            life for us humans until about 12,000 years ago when archaeologic studies show evidence of the emergence of
            agriculture. Human lifestyles began to change as our groups formed permanent settlements and tended crops.
            There are still a few hunter-gatherer peoples today. You can expolore their lifestyle in this video: </p>

            Apart from my daily duties, I'm one of the most talented painers in my clan.Images painted, drawn
            or carved onto rocks and cave walls, which have been found across the globe, reflect one of humans’ earliest
            forms of communication, with possible connections to language development. The earlest known images often
            appear abstract, and may have been symbolic, while later ones depicted animals, people and hybrid figures
            that perhaps carried some kind of spiritual significance. Come, join me join me for a tour in one of our
            most famous palo art sites, the <a href="https://archeologie.culture.gouv.fr/lascaux/en/visit-cave"

            The first animal to make the transition from the wild to the domesticated state was my friend the wolf, the
            common
            ancestor of all modern-day dogs. This occurred at least 12,000 – 14,000 years ago when I discovered that
            young wolf cubs that remained subordinate to humans as adults could be trained.If you want to know more
